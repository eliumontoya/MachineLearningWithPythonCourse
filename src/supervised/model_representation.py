you will use the motivating example of housing price prediction.
This lab will use a simple data set with only two data points - a house with 1000 square feet(sqft) 
sold for $300,000 and a house with 2000 square feet sold for $500,000. These two points will constitute 
our data or training set. In this lab, the units of size are 1000 sqft and the units of price are 1000s of dollars.

Size (1000 sqft)    Price (1000s of dollars)
1.0    300
2.0    500
You would like to fit a linear regression model (shown above as the blue straight line) 
through these two points, so you can then predict price for other houses - say, a house with 1200 sqft.

plt.style.use('./deeplearning.mplstyle')

# x_train is the input variable (size in 1000 square feet)
# y_train is the target (price in 1000s of dollars)
x_train = np.array([1.0, 2.0])
y_train = np.array([300.0, 500.0])
print(f"x_train = {x_train}")
print(f"y_train = {y_train}")


# m is the number of training examples
print(f"x_train.shape: {x_train.shape}")
m = x_train.shape[0]
print(f"Number of training examples is: {m}")

# m is the number of training examples
m = len(x_train)
print(f"Number of training examples is: {m}")



i = 0 # Change this to 1 to see (x^1, y^1)

x_i = x_train[i]
y_i = y_train[i]
print(f"(x^({i}), y^({i})) = ({x_i}, {y_i})")



# Plot the data points
plt.scatter(x_train, y_train, marker='x', c='r')
# Set the title
plt.title("Housing Prices")
# Set the y-axis label
plt.ylabel('Price (in 1000s of dollars)')
# Set the x-axis label
plt.xlabel('Size (1000 sqft)')

As described in lecture, the model function for linear regression (which is a function that maps from x to y) is represented as

洧녭洧녻,洧녪(洧논(洧녰))=洧녻洧논(洧녰)+洧녪(1)
The formula above is how you can represent straight lines - different values of  洧녻
  and  洧녪
  give you different straight lines on the plot.

Let's try to get a better intuition for this through the code blocks below. Let's start with 
 洧녻=100
  and  洧녪=100
Note: You can come back to this cell to adjust the model's w and b parameters

w = 100
b = 100

Prediction
Now that we have a model, we can use it to make our original prediction. Let's predict the price of a house with 1200 sqft. Since the units of  洧논
  are in 1000's of sqft,  洧논
  is 1.2.
'''
  
w = 200                         
b = 100    
x_i = 1.2
cost_1200sqft = w * x_i + b    

print(f"${cost_1200sqft:.0f} thousand dollars")

## Cost Function Visualization- 3D

You can see how cost varies with respect to *both* `w` and `b` by plotting in 3D or using a contour plot.   
It is worth noting that some of the plotting in this course can become quite involved. The plotting routines are provided and while it can be instructive to read through the code to become familiar with the methods, it is not needed to complete the course successfully. The routines are in lab_utils_uni.py in the local directory.
