Problem StatementÂ¶
You would like a model which can predict housing prices given the size of the house.
Let's use the same two data points as before the previous lab- a house with 1000 square feet sold for $300,000 and a house with 2000 square feet sold for $500,000.

Size (1000 sqft)    Price (1000s of dollars)
1    300
2    500

'''

x_train = np.array([1.0, 2.0])           #(size in 1000 square feet)
y_train = np.array([300.0, 500.0])           #(price in 1000s of dollars)



def compute_cost(x, y, w, b): 
    """
    Computes the cost function for linear regression.
    
    Args:
      x (ndarray (m,)): Data, m examples 
      y (ndarray (m,)): target values
      w,b (scalar)    : model parameters  
    
    Returns
        total_cost (float): The cost of using w,b as the parameters for linear regression
               to fit the data points in x and y

    # number of training examples
    m = x.shape[0] 
    
    cost_sum = 0 
    for i in range(m): 
        f_wb = w * x[i] + b   
        cost = (f_wb - y[i]) ** 2  
        cost_sum = cost_sum + cost  
    total_cost = (1 / (2 * m)) * cost_sum
